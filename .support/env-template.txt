# When sideband adapters make the /sideband/response call, the PingDataGovernance Server can be configured to accept
# request context data in different ways, enabling support for API gateways with different capability sets. The
# following environment variable is used by the PingDataGovernance server as the value for request-context-method.
# Use the following guidelines when selecting a value for request-context-method.
#
#  - Use "state" if the API gateway and sideband adapter support relaying data from the response from /sideband/request
#    to /sideband/response. This is the most performant option as token owner information lookup is only performed once.
#  - Use "response" if the API gateway and sideband adapter support providing the same data sent to /sideband/request
#    as a property in the request to /sideband/response. This is less performant than "state" as the token owner
#    information lookup is performed during calls to both /sideband/request and /sideband/response.
#  - Use "none" if the API gateway and sideband adapter are not capable of providing request data to /sideband/response.
#    Under these circumstances, policy writers will need to be aware that request data will not be available on outbound
#    policies.
